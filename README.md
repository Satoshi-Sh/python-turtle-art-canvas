## Running the program

You need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Or use your favorite package manager.

### Windows

To run the program, open the root directory in your terminal and type `python main.py`. If you have mutliple versions of Python installed on your computer, you can use `py -<version number> main.py` for example `py -3.9 main.py` to ensure you are using Python 3 and not Python 2.

### Mac

To run the program, open the root directory in your terminal and type `python main.py`. If you have mutliple versions of Python installed on your computer, you can use `python -<version number> main.py` for example `python3.9 main.py` to ensure you are using Python 3 and not Python 2.

• CD into the folder that contain main.py
• type Python3 main.py
• the turtle window should open

### Linux

Install python3-tk on your system, if you haven't done yet.

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

• CD into the python-turtle-art-canvas

• type python3 main.py in terminal

• the turtle window should open

## Roadmap

2023: Re-promote the project and accept contributions to a basic Turtle Graphics canvas.

The future: Build on this by creating a user interface, probably a command line interface, and multiple canvases.

Other ideas on how to extend the project are welcome and can be put forward at any time using the 'Suggestion' issue template.
